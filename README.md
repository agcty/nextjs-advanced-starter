# Nextjs Advanced Starter

An opinionated starter skeleton with advanced features for Next.js. 

Use tailwind css, eslint, prettier & absolute imports instantly. Easily extendable zero-config template for pros and beginners.

## Why?
This project aims to provide a minimal well-thought-out base for building advanced Next.js powered websites.

It combines some of the best trending features and gives you a comfortable development environment to get started.
The reason why it exists is because I absolutely hate setting up the same stack twice. Especially getting eslint + prettier + absolute imports to work (well) together is super annoying and I don't any people to be annoyed by it.

most tedious things are usually the easiest ones to implement (once you know what you're doing).
If you've ever set up an eslint config with auto-formatting and absolute imports for a new project from scratch you probably know the struggle.

For Pros: You don't have to copy the same config over to a new project.
For Beginners: Start coding like the pros without setting up configs for days.

## How can I use this?
If you are a newcomer to Next.js who's interested in the features a lot pros use, this is a great place to start without worrying about errors.
If you are pro and interested in a base-templat for building ultra-fast websites, you can use this project as a "minimal" starter.
